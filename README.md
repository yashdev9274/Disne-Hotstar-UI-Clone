# Disne-Hotstar-Clone
In this repository, I've create a disney plus UI clone using HTML, CSS and JS only. No other library. I've added an endless slider effect. Which took me 2-3 hrs to code.

My clone is very similar to the original disney plus website. It is only one page(homepage) website. It has navbar and search box with cool click effect same as disney+ and it also has a slider or carousel with infinity or endless effect. Which was very hard for me to make at first. And after that we also have movie cards. With awesome card hover effect. And along with that I contains so many more stuffs.
